# Infinite.Play

General Assembly Project - Unit 2
Due: 25/05/2024

## Getting Started

## What is Infinite.Play?

Infinite.Play is a digital storefront akin to store.steampowered.com - a market leading digital storefront made as a hub for games. Infinite.Play will be focusing on the storefront only, as emulating other functions and widgets used in Steam is beyond my capabilities at this stage.

This means that Infinite.Play will offer users:
-[ ] User sign up and log in
-[ ] A storefront/Welcome splash page that will include featured game listings
-[ ] Each listing will show a thumbnail preview with the price tag in the bottom corner for easy scrolling/viewing
-[ ] Game details page(s) where each game can have its own detailed page with screenshots, a description, and user reviews
-[ ] Users submitting their own reviews/thoughts to the game listing(s)
-[ ] Users adding/removing item(s) from their personal wishlist
-[ ] Users submitting their own games to the database
-[ ] Possibly more

## Technologies Used

For Unit 2, we have learned how to utilize Express, using a database (MongoDB), MongooseJS, Render deployment, referencing APIs, OAuth authentication, and testing using node.

Infinite.Play will be making use of 

-[x] Express
-[x] MongooseJS
-[x] Render
-[x] OAuth

At this point in time, I haven't searched for relevant API that I can use. If there are none, then I'll have to create each item in MongoDB for use.
